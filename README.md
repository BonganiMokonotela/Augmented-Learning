# Augmented-Learning
The project is developed for grade 12 learners doing Physical and Life science subjects in South Africa. The project uses augmented reality technology to overlay virtual three dimensional (3D) objects on to the real world, using an android smartphone with appropriate sensors (Gyroscope, Proximity Sensor, Accelerometer and Light Sensor). The project is a marker-based augmented mobile application. A marker-based augmented reality is a type of augmented reality that allows the user to scan images (otherwise known as markers) to display virtual objects, these objects are overlaid onto the image being scanned. Overlaid objects will be for physical and life sciences depending on the picture scanned by the user.
